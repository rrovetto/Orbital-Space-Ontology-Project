## Summary
This on-going project consists of developing a living domain reference model (or a knowledge model), in the form of an ontology suite for astronautics (spaceflight), the orbital space environemnt, space situational awareness (SSA), and space traffic coordination/management (STC/M) here collectively called the 'orbital space domain', 'space domain', or 'astronautical domain'. It is neutral with respect to nation and sector (civil, gov't, mil, etc.), but tailored models can be built for a given actor or sector. The ontologies will provide formal representaitons of phenomena such as orbits, orbital knowledge, spacecraft, orbital debris, spacecraft maneuvers, orbital events, observational and other SSA data, spaceflight missions (and their space systems, ground systems, phases, objectives, etc.), as well as space traffic management and space policy concepts. These, and related, entities will be grouped into modular ontologies the whole of which may be merged into a single master ontology file. Together this is intended to form a unified knowledge model of the target domain, providing a semantic layer for data, and providing knowledge representation, metadata elements, vocabularies, and ontologies for astronautics and SSA.  

## Purpose
* To support safe spaceflight and space situational awareness
* To provide a set of modular, re-usable, neutral, but dynamic ontologies for astronautics and related discplines
* To form a unified knowlege model of the target domain
* To offer accurate formal representations of the target objects and domain knowledge
* To offer a set of vocabularies, taxonomies, metadata schemas, and classificaitons that are comprehensible, accurate and widely-applicable

## Ontologies under development
(subject to revision, merger, etc.)

The following ontologies are conceived as part of a modular architecture. Some or all may compose a single master ontology that I call The Orbital Space Onology (OSO), or The Space Domain Ontology. There are various synonymous names that may be given to this ontology suite, depending on scoping, such as: 'Astronautical Ontology Suite', 'Orbital Space Domain Ontology' (OSDO), and 'Orbital Space Environment Domain Ontology' (OSEDO). Each modular ontology can be used for a specific purpose, application, or organizational office, e.g. NASA's Orbital Debris Program Office may use The Orbital Debris Ontology. All content is subject to revision. If interested, contact the author.

* **ODO - The Orbital Debris Ontology**
  An ontology representing orbital debris objects, and related things.
  https://purl.org/space-ontology/odo
* **SSAO - The Space Situational Awareness Ontology**
  An ontology for SSA processes, data, actors, and infrastructure, which yield actionable knowledge of orbital space environment.
  https://purl.org/space-ontology/ssao
* **OO - The Orbital Ontology Core (the "Orbitology Ontology")**
  A general-purpose ontology for (i) fundamental orbital concepts, (ii) representing the orbits of any satellite, (iii) providing a common orbital terminology for other ontologies. This is a base ontology consisting of generic but domain-specific classes for orbital entities for space domain ontologies. 
* **The Celestial Orbit Type Ontology (the Gravitaitonal/Astronomical Orbit Type Ontology)**
An ontology of orbit categories. An orbit type taxonomy with features unique to each.
* **OEO - Orbital Event & Process Ontology (the Orbital Activity Ontology)**
  An ontology of occurrences in orbit, e.g. collisions.
* **OOO - Orbital Object Ontology**
  An ontology of objects in orbital motion about some central body or barycenter. 
* **Space Mission Ontology**
  An ontology of generic Space mission design concepts.
* **NESEO - THe Near-Earth Space Environment Ontology**
  An ontology specifically for the near-Earth environment. This can be an ontological model of instance data, whereas OSO and the SSAO capture universal concepts. 
* **AMO - The Astrodynamics Modeling Ontology**
  An ontology of the astrodynamic models for objects in orbits. 
* **SWO - Space Weather Ontology**
  An ontology of space weather phenomena as contrasted with space artefacs such as artificial orbital debris. 
  SWO classes may be found in existing astronomy ontologies(TBD)  
* **OSO/OSDO/OSEDO - The Orbital Space Ontology / Orbital Space Domain Ontology / Orbital Space Environment Domain Ontology**
  The broadest scope encompassing and consisting of the following ontologies. A generic formal represenation for the orbital space about any central body or 
  astronomical reference frame.  
* **UCSSO - The Union of Concerned Scientists Satellite Ontology**
  A case-study demonstration of building an ontology for a specific database. This is an ontology for UCS Satellite Database, not intended for any other (but intended to show that the SSAO or the OSO can be used for any database). 
  https://purl.org/space-ontology/ucsso
* **STMO - The Space Traffic Management Ontology (Space Traffic Coordination Ontology)**
  An ontology of STM concepts, to include organization, coordination and other activities for traffic in the orbital space environment.

## History, Author Bio-Contextual-Efforts
This has been a pursuit since 2011 when I thought of applying ontology to the orbital debris domain to help ameliorate the debris hazard via ontology-based data-sharing and integration (documented proof & references available upon request). I continue to search for an opportunity to work sustainably on and complete this project, ideally in a team environment with professionals, e.g., astrodynamics, astroinformatics, computer science, and ontological engineering. I have developed enough paper concepts to make this a PhD project, so I hope to enter a degree program involving study of astronauitcs and orbital dynamics (my original passion).
