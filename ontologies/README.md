# Under construction
This folder will tentatively contain the ontologies under development.

This project has been pursued without support, in the authors spare time, since inception 2011. 
The project needs formal support to sustain development, and to provide a safe/secure means to publicly release the in-progress works 
Please consider supporting through: [donations](https://gogetfunding.com/creating-meaning-full-space-terminologies-knowledge-models-for-space-safety/), sponsoring, or formal word collaborations (e.g. employment offers, or PhD study opportunities so the author can sustainably continue development in a stable, learning, and protected environment). 

Ideal goals for formal support: a PhD study opportunity for this project, funding/grants for a long-term work period, or employment with an employer willing to support it.

Ontologies are presently available as pay-per-download.
Ontology development services are available by formal work arrangement. 

Please [contact here](https://ontospace.wordpress.com) if you are interested in sponsoring, formally collaborating, or purchasing use of an ontology.

_Implementation Language_: currently, OWL is use, but it is anticipated/desired that KIF, CLIF, and other more expressive knowledge represenation languages will be use.
